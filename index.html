                                            <p>I've been doing web development and design for around 6 years and, although I only have 2 years industry experience, I believe myself to be very capable at both.</p>
                                            <p>I started on development a few years before I went to college, mostly coding in PHP and MySQL and working on very basic websites with very little functionality. At college I met my now best friend who was also equally passionate about learning web development so we partnered up, going home after college every night and learning as much as we could to later teach each other the next day.</p>
                                            <p>It wasn't long before we could both manage to code fairly complex applications and websites when we hit a dead end, neither of us could make our websites look very pretty. It was then when I decided I'd have a go at design.</p>
                                            <p>For whatever reason designing came very easy to me, which was surprising as I've never been great at art. I spent the remainder of college perfecting my development skills while mostly focusing on teaching myself to design.</p>

                                        <div class="col col_1third">
                                            <p>Straight after college I landed a job with Armadillo Creative as a developer. I was lucky enough to be working with some incredibly capable developers who helped me fully grasp how to develop complicated websites for fairly large clients. On top of everything I learned code-wise I also had to put my comminucation skills at test as I was personally handed my own clients to work with. This involved everything from the initial briefing and planning to ensuring everything was perfect for them. I always had a nice relationship with all of my clients and they always seemed very impressed not only with their finished product, but the customer care and service I strived to provide.</p>
                                            <p>After my time with Armadillo Creative came to an end I landed a job with brand new London startup Givey. I moved down to London and worked as the only in house developer and designer.</p>

                                            <p>I have always been very passionate about web development and design, and in my dry periods of freelancing I'm always trying to build the next 'big thing'. I have started up a few small businesses, none of which went so well, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>
                                            <p>I'm often referred to as the 'cutting-edge guy' because I'm constantly learning about the newest technologies and applying them into my work. This ranges from new Database models to rest APIs (Facebook/Twitter/etc).</p>
                                            <p>I've been told I work incredibly well as part of a team but if there's a lot of work to be done I can easily jump straight into it with earphones in and get it out of the way.</p>
